Hi, my name is Matt, and I'm into software engineering, technology, and everything like that.

I live and work in my native New Zealand, where I work at a software company and study computer science and information systems.

My first taste of coding I got when I was about 10 years old; I had a website on Yola - a drag-and-drop site builder. I would insert HTML iframes for other sites, essentially making a dashboard of sorts for all my daily tasks like checking my hotmail and playing Runescape (it was a different time). I had several pages which I lost edit access to due to redirects because I embedded an SSL site - there were many "new new new new email" pages.

But I eventually found out about PHP, and I was so totally hooked - I got some basic free hosting on a now-defunct service called 'Azok' ([R.I.P.](https://web.archive.org/web/20120212022309/http://azok.org:80/)), and followed some tutorials I found on YouTube. Most of these had something related to my current interest which was, of course, Minecraft. You can bet I had a Minecraft server.

So I built some things to manage the server, display its status on a Wordpress site I was using to market it, and I even built an online item store from scratch, where people could buy items for use in-game. The currency was based on the time they spent playing on the server, how creative!

After a little while, I got involved with the forums of the YouTube channel that I was learning PHP from. I ended up volunteering to help other people with problems in their code, but in a way that they would learn.

Nowadays, I'm much less focused on PHP. I like to use C# and Javascript/Node in most of my projects, because of their wider applications and tooling.
