My public PGP key for `mattlc_3@icloud.com` can be found here:

* [.NZ Keyserver](http://pgp.net.nz:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xF140CE93F7551EA6) (`F140CE93F7551EA6`)
* [Asc file](https://crookm.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/documents/2019/pubkey/mattlc_3-icloud.pub.asc) (`mattlc_3-icloud.pub.asc`)

The .NZ keyserver has peerings with most of the popular key servers, [outlined here](https://pgp.net.nz/pages/peers.html), that you can just search for me by key id or email on your favourite.

I just listed the .NZ server because it's the only one I know of that's always online. MIT's server was down at the time of writing, big surprise.
