You want to contact me? Exciting! I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about myself, my subject of study, or anything that I may have a little bit of expertise in, and of course any polite chit-chat! Please don't contact me with unsolicited offers.

**Twitter**: [@mattlc_3](https://twitter.com/mattlc_3)   
**Email**: [mcro591+blog@aucklanduni.ac.nz](mailto:mcro591+blog@aucklanduni.ac.nz)

I prefer a Twitter DM over email any day, but an email is still okay. Please leave the 'plus code' so I know where you got my email from.

To encrypt stuff to send to me for whatever reason, check out my [PGP](/contact/pgp/) page to get my public key.
