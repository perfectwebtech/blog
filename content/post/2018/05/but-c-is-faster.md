So over the c/++ elitists who say they only develop in C because it's 'so much faster than all those other interpreted languages' \*cout >> "scoff"\*

What's really the point of developing in c/++, when other languages do just as good or even better, and are faster and simpler to develop in?

Maintainability is more important than small increases in running efficiency, for most use cases (scientific work obviously excluded).

Does your point-and-click adventure game really need the efficiency of c/++, when you're constantly having to search StackOverflow to do otherwise simple things?
