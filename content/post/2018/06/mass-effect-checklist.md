I wanted to build something for my portfolio, so I decided to over-engineer something basic with a sketchy idea: the Mass Effect Checklist! ðŸ˜ƒ

Mass Effect is by far my favourite game series, I've played through the game so many times that I could just-about recite everything by heart.

To aid in my unhealthy addiction, I created a list of things that I need to do - allowing me to get to the ending that I like the most. Sometimes I forget what I'm supposed to do or how to do something, and end up having to go over to the Wiki. The problem is, the Wiki is hard to follow. I felt like this checklist format is easier and more logical.

It's currently at something of an MVP stage, and at the time of writing, I haven't even finished typing-up all the missions. At the moment it's just a proof-of-concept.

I've recently forced my friend to finally experience the game, so he's my test guinea pig.

Future changes will mostly be on UX, interactivity (such as a success calculator for certain missions), <s>a timeline to show an overview of the list</s>, <s>syncing the checklist to the cloud</s>, and maybe a saved-game upload functionality - to check the list based on your progression, check success requirements for missions before you even get to them, and show some stats that are normally hidden in the game.
