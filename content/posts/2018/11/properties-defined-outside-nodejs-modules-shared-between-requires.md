If you use Node.js modules in any capacity, you may or may not benefit from the knowledge that properties defined outside the module are shared between every `require()` you call.

This is just a quick post, because I couldn't find anything right-away on the internet - so I ended up checking it out for myself.

I wanted to be able to call a module through require, so I could do some cleanup when my service received a `SIGHUP` or `SIGTERM` - and I didn't have to make my code any longer by defining it in a variable. I know, it's lazy and maybe a bad design pattern ðŸ˜¬
